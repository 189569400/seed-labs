The above \urlisorurlsare is only accessible from inside of the virtual machine, because we
have modified the \texttt{/etc/hosts} file to map the domain
name of each URL to the virtual machine's local IP
address ({\tt 127.0.0.1}).
You may map any domain name to a particular IP address using
\texttt{/etc/hosts}. For example, you can map
\url{http://www.example.com} to the local IP address by appending the
following entry to \texttt{/etc/hosts}:

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor=]
   127.0.0.1     www.example.com
\end{lstlisting}

If your web server and browser are running on two different machines, you need
to modify \texttt{/etc/hosts} on the browser's machine accordingly to map these
domain names to the web server's IP address, not to {\tt 127.0.0.1}.
