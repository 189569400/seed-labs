\paragraph{The {\tt Elgg} Web Application.}
We use an open-source web application called {\tt Elgg} in this lab.
{\tt Elgg} is a web-based social-networking application. 
It is already set up in the 
pre-built \ubuntu VM image.  
We have also created several user accounts on the {\tt Elgg} server and the credentials are given below.
