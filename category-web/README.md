# Web Security

This folder contains web security labs.

- Cross-Site Scripting Attack Lab
- Cross-Site Request Forgery Attack Lab
- SQL Injection Attack Lab


## Note on Ubuntu 20.04 VM

All the three labs have been tested on the new Ubuntu 20.04 VM.
No change is needed, so they can be directly used on the new VM.


## TODO

I hope that we can develop more web security labs. Here is a list of 
the topics that we can pursue:

- Use a different web application for XSS and CSRF. Right now, these
two labs are based on the Elgg web application. Introducing more 
web applications give instructors more choices.

- A lab focusing on the Browser Security. Browser has a lot of interesting
security mechanisms, such as same origin policy, sandbox, etc. It will be
great if we can design a lab based on these mechanisms. 

- A lab focusing on the ClickJacking attack.

- OWASP publishes a list of common vulnerabilities in web applications.
We can develop labs based on some of them, if they are not already covered 
by other SEED labs.
