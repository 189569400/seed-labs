# Creating a VM Instance on Google Cloud


Creating a VM instance on Google cloud is quite straightforward.
When you create the VM instance, we suggest the following parameters:

## Step 1: Machine configuration 

2 vCPU and 4GB of memory is more desirable. However, 
one vCPU and 2GB is sufficient for most SEED labs. You can
easily change the machine configuration later after the machine
is created.

## Step 2: Boot disk 

Choose the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system.
For the disk size, 20 GB is more desirable, but 10 GB will work.

## Step 3: Set up Firewall
