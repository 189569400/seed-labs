We use four categories to describe how much change is made to
the lab description and files.
- ```None```: No change is made, or just some simple changes
on the writing

- ```Minor```: Minor changes

- ```Major```: Major changes.

- ```New```: This is a new lab specifically designed for Ubuntu 20.04.
It could be from an existing lab, but completely redesigned
