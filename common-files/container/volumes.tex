Code editing is more convenient inside the VM than in a container, 
because we can use our favorite editor to write code. 
In order for the VM and a container to share files, 
we have created a shared folder between VM and the container
using the Docker \texttt{volumes}.
If you look at the Docker Compose file, you will find out that
we have added the following entry to some of the containers.
It indicates mounting the \texttt{./volumes} folder on the host
machine (i.e., the VM) to the \texttt{/volumes} folder inside the container.
We will write our code in the \texttt{./volumes} folder (on the VM), so they
can be used inside the containers.
