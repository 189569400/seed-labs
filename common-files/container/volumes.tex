\paragraph{Volumes.} In this lab, we need to write code and then run
the code inside containers. Code editing is more convenient inside
the VM, so we will do it from the VM. Using the Docker \texttt{volumes},
we can create a shared folder between VM and the container.
If you look at the \texttt{docker-compose.yml} file, you will find out that
we have added the following entry to the VPN client and server containers.
It indicates mounting the \texttt{./volumes} folder on the host
machine (i.e., the VM) to the \texttt{/volumes} folder inside the container.
We will write our code in the \texttt{./volumes} folder (on the VM), so they
can be used inside the containers.
