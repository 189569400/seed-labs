\paragraph{Container setup and commands.}
Please download the
\texttt{Labsetup.zip} file to your VM from the lab's website,
unzip it, enter the \texttt{Labsetup} folder, and 
use the \texttt{docker-compose.yml} file to 
set up the lab environment. Detailed explanation
of the content in this file and all the involved 
\texttt{Dockerfile} can be found from the 
user manual, which can be downloaded from the website. 
If this is the first time you set up a SEED lab environment
using Docker and Compose, it is very important that you read 
the user manual. 

In the following, we list some of the commonly
used commands related to Docker and Compose. 
Since we are going to use 
these commands and several docker commands very
frequently, we have created aliases for these commands
in the \texttt{.bashrc} file.  


\begin{lstlisting}
$ docker-compose build  # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up     # Start the container
$ docker-compose down   # Shut down the container

// Aliases for commonly used docker and Compose commands. 
$ dcbuild       # Alias for: docker-compose build
$ dcup          # Alias for: docker-compose up
$ dcdown        # Alias for: docker-compose down
$ dockps        # Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}}  {{.Names}}" 
$ docksh <id>   # Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
\end{lstlisting}


If you encounter problems when setting up the lab environment, 
please read the ``Common Problems'' section of the manual
for potential solutions.
