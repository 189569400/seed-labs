\paragraph{Container setup and commands.}



The Docker and Compose files, along with the user manual,
can be downloaded from the lab's website,
The followings Compose commands are for creating and tearing down
the lab environment. 
Since we are going to use 
these commands and several docker commands very
frequently, we have created aliases for these commands
in the \texttt{.bashrc} file.  


\begin{lstlisting}
$ docker-compose build  # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up     # Start the container
$ docker-compose down   # Shut down the container

// Aliases for commonly used docker and Compose commands. 
$ dcbuild       # Alias for: docker-compose build
$ dcup          # Alias for: docker-compose up
$ dcdown        # Alias for: docker-compose down
$ dockps        # Alias for: docker ps --format "{{.ID}}  {{.Names}}" 
$ docksh <id>   # Alias for: docker exec -it <id> /bin/bash
\end{lstlisting}



Detailed explanation of \texttt{Dockerfile} and
the \texttt{docker-compose.yml} file can be found from
the manual, which is linked to this lab's website. If you encounter
issues when setting up the lab environment, read the
``Common Problems'' section for potential solutions.
