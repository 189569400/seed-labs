These are the common images used by SEED labs. For all the 
images listed here, other than the `seed-dns` images, we have already
pre-built the images, and pushed them to the Docker Hub, 
in the `handsonsecurity` namespace. 
Most labs build their containers using these pre-built images
as the bases. 

The `seed-dns` images are built upon the bases from our Docker Humb images.
Other than the bases, they only contain local files. Therefore, we decided
not to push them to the Docker Hub. Students will just build the images
when they set up the lab; it does not take much time.
