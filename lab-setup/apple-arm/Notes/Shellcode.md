# Shellcode 

We wrote a new 64-bit shellcode for Ubuntu 22.04 running on
the AArch64 architecture. Some of the lab tasks are based on
the 32-bit code (including the buffer overflow labs and the shellcode lab).
However, since we will eventually phase out the tasks related to 
the 32-bit code, we have decided not to pursue the 32-bit 
ARM shellcode. 

We will provide two versions for this lab, one for the AMD64 and the 
other for the ARM64.
