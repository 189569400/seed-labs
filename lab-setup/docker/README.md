# Container Files



Each SEED lab will have a folder called ```Labsetup```, which contains
all the container files needed by that lab. Since many SEED labs 
share a similar setup, to avoid duplication, we create this folder 
to store the standard container files. 
Here are the general guidelines how this folder should be 
used by each SEED lab.


- Image file (standard): we put several standard container image files
in this folder. If a SEED lab needs to use one of these standard images without
making any change, use a symbolic link to link to the corresponding image 
inside this folder. 

- If a SEED lab needs to make some changes to a standard SEED container image,
it can copy the image file from this folder. 


## For Website

We will zip all the files together into ```Labsetup.zip```, and link it 
to the lab's web page. The ```zip``` program will automatically replace 
all the symbolic links with the actual files/folders.
