# Container Files

Each SEED lab will have a folder called `Labsetup`, which contains
all the container files needed by that lab. We have made 
some base images for SEED labs. The are stored in 
the `docker-images` (in the parent folder). 

For each lab, we will zip all the lab setup files into `Labsetup.zip`, 
and link it to the lab's web page. The `zip` program will automatically 
replace all the symbolic links with the actual files/folders. 

## Manuals

Manuals are stored inside `documents`.
