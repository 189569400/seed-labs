# TODO

We will document issues and suggestions coming up during the beta testing. 

- We forgot to add the following to `/etc/hosts`
```
10.9.0.80       www.seedlab-hashlen.com
``` 

- Put the SEED alias in `.bash_aliases`, instead of putting them in
the `.bashrc` file. This way, the aliases can be easily imported
to other shells. This file is sourced by a command inside 
the `.bashrc` file.  Need to update the files in the `src` and `src-slim` folders.
