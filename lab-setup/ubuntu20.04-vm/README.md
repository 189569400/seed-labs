# Building SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM

Files in this folder contain the scripts we 
use to build the 64-bit SEED Ubuntu 20.0 VM. 

## Beta Testing

We plan to use Spring 2021 for the Beta Testing of this VM. During
this phase, we hope to fix all the problems in the VM and lab 
description. 


## Official Release Date

We plan to officially release Ubuntu 20.04 VM, along with revised SEED labs in Summer 2021.
