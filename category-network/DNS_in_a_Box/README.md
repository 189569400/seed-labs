# DNS In a Box Lab

This is a newly designed lab; it is not released yet. 
The lab uses the container technology, and it builds
the miniature DNS infrastructure inside a single VM.
It is based on the Ubuntu 20.04 VM. A beta version of the 
VM can be downloaded from here: https://seed.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/SEEDUbuntu-20.04-v1.vdi.zip
