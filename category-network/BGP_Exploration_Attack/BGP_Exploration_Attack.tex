\section{Overview}

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the standard exterior gateway protocol
designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous
systems (AS) on the Internet. It is the ``glue'' of the Internet,
and is an essential piece of the Internet infrastructure. It is 
also a primary attack target, because if attackers can 
compromise BGP, they can disconnect the Internet and redirect traffics. 

The goal of this lab is to help students understand how
BGP ``glues'' the Internet together, and how the Internet is actually
connected. We have built an Internet emulator, and will 
use this emulator as the basis for the lab activities. Due to the 
complexity of BGP, a significant portion of this lab description 
is devoted to explaining how BGP works. They are 
essential for the lab activities. 
This lab covers the following topics:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item How the BGP protocol works
\item Autonomous systems
\item BGP configuration, BGP Large Communities 
\item Routing 
\item Internet Exchange (IX)
\item BGP attack
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Supporting materials.}
Detailed coverage of the BGP protocol can be found in 
Section 10 of the SEED Lecture at Udemy, \seedisvideo 
It focuses mostly on the theory part, i.e., explaining how the 
BGP protocol and attacks work. 
A detailed manual regarding the practical side of BGP is 
also provided (see the linked document in the web page).
The document describes how to configure BGP in BIRD, which
is the BGP daemon program used in this lab.

\section{The Lab Setup and the SEED Internet Emulator} 

This lab will be performed inside the SEED Internet Emulator (simply
called the Emulator in this document). 
We provide a pre-built emulator in two different forms: (1) Python code,
and (2) container files. The container files are generated from
the Python code, but students need to install the SEED Emulator source 
code from the GitHub to run the Python code. The container files
can be directly used without the Emulator source code. 
Detailed manuals for the Emulator can be found from 
the project's GiHub repository (the link is provided on the web page).
Instructors who would like to customize the emulator can modify the Python
code, generate their own container files, and then provide these
container files to students, replacing the ones included in the 
setup file.

\subsection{The Network Map} 

Each computer (hosts or routers) running inside the Emulator is a docker container.
Users can access these computers using docker commands, such as getting a shell
inside a container.
The Emulator also comes with a very useful web application, 
which visualizes all the hosts, routers, and networks. The 
web application runs inside one of the containers. 
After the Emulator starts, the map can be accessed from this
URL: \url{http://localhost:8080/map.html}.
Users can interact with this map, such as getting a terminal from 
a container, disabling BGP sessions, and set filters to visualize network traffic.
The syntax of the filter is the same as that in \texttt{tcpdump},
because the filter is actually fed into
the \texttt{tcpdump} program running on each container.

\section{Task 1: Stub Autonomous System} 

In this task, we will configure stub autonomous systems. 
Students who are not familiar with the BIRD software should
read the Sections 2, 3, 4, and 6 before working on this task. 

% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 1.a: Understanding AS-155's BGP Configuration} 

Please study the BGP configuration on AS-155, and answer the following question:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Study the BGP configuration file, and understand how it
    peer with others. Do not worry about the filtering part.
    What ASes does AS-155 peer with? 

  \item AS-155 peers with both AS-2 and AS-4, so if AS-155
    loses the connection with one of them, it can still connect
    to the Internet. Please design an experiment to 
    demonstrate this. You can enable/disable BGP sessions
    either from the \texttt{birdc} command or from the 
    graph. In your experiment, please show 
    how the routing table changes when a particular 
    BGP session is disabled. 
\end{itemize}



% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 1.b: Experimenting with Large Communities} 

Due to some technical issue, the connection between AS-4 and AS-156 is broken. 
Since AS-4 is the only service provider for AS-156, this essentially
disconnects AS-156 from the Internet. However, AS-156 still peers with AS-155, 
which is still connected to the Internet, so why is AS-156 not able to 
connect to the Internet?  

While AS-156 and AS-4 are trying to solve the problem, AS-156 holds an 
emergency meeting with AS-155, agreeing to pay AS-155, so its 
traffic can temporarily go through AS-155 to reach the Internet. 
This requires some changes on AS-155's BGP router. 
Please make such changes, so AS-155 can temporarily 
provide a transit service to AS-156.


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 1.c: Observing BGP Update} 

Run \texttt{tcpdump} on another BGP router, use it to monitor the BGP traffic.
Identify the update and withdraw message. When would a withdraw message be 
triggered and when would an update message be triggered? 

\begin{lstlisting}
# ip address

# tcpdump -n -i ix105 -vvvvv port 179
\end{lstlisting}
 
% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 1.d: Configuring AS-180} 

AS-180 is already included in the emulator. It connects to the
IX105 Internet exchange (Houston), but it does not peer with anybody, 
so it is not connected to the Internet. 
In this task, students need to do the following:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Peer AS-180 with AS-171, so they can directly reach each other
  \item Peer AS-180 with the AS-2 and AS-3 transit autonomous systems, so they can
    reach other destination via these transits.
\end{itemize}


In your lab report, please include the content you add to the 
BIRD configuration file, and provide proper explanation.
Please also include screenshots (such as traceroute) to demonstrate 
that your task is successful. 


% *******************************************
% SECTION
% *******************************************
\section{Task 2: Transit Autonomous System} 

If two ASes want to connect, they can peer with each other
at an Internet exchange point. The question is how two ASes in two different locations
get connected to each other. It is hard for them
to find a common location to peer. To solve this problem,
a special type of AS is needed.

This type of AS have BGP routers in many Internet
Exchange Points, where they peer with many other ASes. Once packets get into
its networks, they will be pulled from one IX to another IX (typically via
some internal routers), and eventually
hand it over to another AS. This type of AS provides the transit
service for other ASes. That is how the hosts in one AS can reach the hosts in
another AS, even though these ASes are not peers with each other.
This special of AS is called \textit{Transit AS}.

In this task, we will first understand how a transit AS works and
then we will configure a transit AS in our Internet emulator. 
Students should read Section 7 of the tutorial before working on this task.

% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 2.a: Experimenting with IBGP} 


For the task, we first need to find some traffics that 
go through AS-3. We will ping \texttt{10.164.0.71} from a host in AS-162. Using the 
map client program, we can see that the packets go through
the AS-3 transit AS. If this is not consistent with your observation,
do find some other traffics that go through AS-3. 

We will now disable the IBGP sessions either the map client or 
from the command line. See the following example.

\begin{lstlisting}
bird> show protocols
Name       Proto      Table      State  Since         Info
...
ibgp1      BGP        ---        up     20:19:03.800  Established
ibgp2      BGP        ---        up     20:19:11.921  Established
ibgp3      BGP        ---        up     20:20:50.238  Established

bird> disable ibgp3 
bird> show protocols ibgp3
Name       Proto      Table      State  Since         Info
ibgp3      BGP        ---        down   20:26:44.526
\end{lstlisting}
 
Before disabling IBGP, show the routing table 
on the BGP router (using \texttt{"ip route"}). Compare the 
results before and after disabling IBGP, and explain
your observations. 


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 2.b: Experimenting with IGP} 

In this task, we will disable the OSPF routing protocol, and see 
how it affects the routing. There are several ways to disable
OSPF. One way is to do it inside \texttt{birdc}: 

\begin{lstlisting}
# bridc
birdc> show protocols
...
ospf1      OSPF       t_ospf     up     19:49:43.343  Running
...

birdc> disable ospf1
birdc> show protocols ospf1
ospf1      OSPF       t_ospf     down   19:57:37.187
\end{lstlisting}
 

We pick AS-3 transit autonomous system in this 
task. This AS has four BGP routers, and we pick the one 
connected to the IX-103 (Miami) Internet exchange.
For the task, we also need to find some traffics that 
go through AS-3. 
We will ping \texttt{10.164.0.71} from a host in AS-162. Using the 
map client program, we can see that the packets go through
the AS-3 transit AS. If this is not consistent with your observation,
do find some other traffics that go through AS-3. 


We will now disable the OSPF using one of the methods mentioned above.
Before disabling OSPF, show the routing table 
on the BGP router (using \texttt{"ip route"}). Compare the 
results before and after disabling OSPF. Based on the 
observation, explain why the IGP is essential for the transit 
autonomous systems. 


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 2.c: Configuring AS-5} 

The transit autonomous system AS-5 is already included in the emulator. 
It connects to three 
Internet exchanges: IX-101, IX-103, and IX-105 Internet exchange,
but it does not peer with anybody. Its topology can be found 
in Figure~\ref{bgp:fig:as5}.
In this task, students need to conduct the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Establish the IBGP inside AS-5 (this part is already created 
    inside the emulator, so we need to remove it before giving the container 
    files to students). The OSPF is also created, but we will keep it. 

  \item Peer AS-5 with AS-153, AS-160, AS-171, with AS-5 being their service provider.

  \item Peer AS-5 with the AS-3 at IX-103 (Miami). Since they are both Tier-1 ASes,
    they don't pay each other, and their relationship is peer-to-peer.
\end{itemize}


In your lab report, please include the content you add to the 
BIRD configuration file, and provide proper explanation.
Please also include screenshots (such as traceroute) to demonstrate 
that your task is successful. 


% *******************************************
% SECTION
% *******************************************
\section{Task 3: Path Selection} 

BGP routers typically receive multiple routes to the same network. 
All these routes will be kept, but BGP will run a best route 
selection algorithm to choose one route as the current best route. 
This route will be the one announced to the peers; 
it is also the one given to the kernel routing table, 
so routing is based on this selected route. 
When the best route is retracted, BGP router re-runs the 
best route selection algorithm to find the current best route. 

The top-2 criteria used by BIRD is the following:
(1) prefer route with the highest Local Preference attribute,
(2) prefer route with the shortest AS path. In this task, we will
experiment with these two criteria, and see how they affect 
the path selection. Students should read Section 5 of the tutorials
before working on this task.


\paragraph{Task 3.a.} The \texttt{"birdc show route all > all-routes"} command
can list all the BGP routes (the output is quite long, so it is better to
save the output to a file). The \texttt{"ip route"} command
can list all the entries in the kernel routing table. 

Go to AS-150's BGP router, and show all the BGP routes. Find a network prefix
that has more than one routes. Explain their differences. Compare these 
routes to the entries in the kernel routing table, and identify which route is 
selected as the best route, and explain why this route is selected? 


\paragraph{Task 3.b.}
AS-150 peers with both AS-2 and AS-3, which provides the 
Internet services to AS-150.
However, because the link to AS-2 is slower than
the link to AS-3, AS-150 wants 
to use AS-2 only as the backup upstream link, i.e., 
AS-150's inbound and outbound traffic should 
always use AS-3, unless the link is broken. 
Please modify AS-150's BGP configuration to achieve this goal.



% *******************************************
% SECTION
% *******************************************
\section{Task 4: IP Anycast} 

IP Anycast is a network addressing and routing methodology in which a single
IP address is shared by multiple machines (usually in different locations).
When we send a packet to this IP address, one of the computers will get 
the packet. Exactly which one will get it is hard to tell, because it depends
on the routing. IP anycast is naturally supported by BGP. 
One of the well-known applications of IP anycast is DNS, 
as all 13 root servers A–M exist in multiple locations. 


On the emulator map, type \texttt{190} in the search box, you will find 
out that AS-190 has two networks, but they are disconnected. One network
is connected to IX-100, and the other is connected to IX-105. A closer 
look at these two networks will reveal that these two networks have the 
identical network prefix \texttt{10.190.0.0/24}. The only hosts on
these two networks have the identical IP address \texttt{10.190.0.100}. 

Please find two different hosts in the emulator, so 
when you ping \texttt{10.190.0.100} from these two hosts, 
the destinations are different (even though the destination
IP address is the same). Please set the filter on the map to
\texttt{icmp} to visualize the packet trace, then 
look at the BGP routers on the path, and explain why
the packets reach two different destinations. 



% *******************************************
% SECTION
% *******************************************
\section{Task 5: BGP Prefix Attack} 

BGP Route Hijacking, also called prefix hijacking, is a typical
attack on BGP. In this attack, the attackers' BGP routers 
announce the IP prefix that are not assigned to them, so
the traffic to this IP prefix can get rerouted to the 
attackers, who can intercept or modify the traffic.
Many of the incidents on the Internet are caused by
such an ``attack'', although they are mostly caused 
by the mis-configured BGP routers.


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 5.a. Launching the Prefix Hijacking Attack from AS-160} 

In this task, we will launch the prefix hijacking attack
using a BGP router in AS-160. Our goal is to hijack
the IP prefix owned by AS-156. If the attack is successful,
all the packets going to AS-156 will be rerouted to AS-160, where
they will be dropped. Essentially, we are black holing AS-156.

The prefixes announced by a BGP router can come from different 
sources: they can come from the \texttt{direct} protocol, 
i.e., they are obtained from the actual network interface attached
to the BGP router. They can also come from \texttt{static} protocol,
which contains pre-defined routes. The easiest way for a BGP router to 
announce a prefix that it does not own is to use 
the \texttt{static} protocol. The following  
example creates a pre-defined route to \texttt{10.130.0.0/16}. 
See Section 3 of the tutorial for detailed explanation of the static protocol.
It should be noted that in the filter part of the route,
we need to add the route to the \texttt{LOCAL\_COMM} community; 
otherwise, the BGP router will not export it to the outside.   

\begin{lstlisting}
protocol static {
    ipv4 {
        table t_bgp;
    };
    route 10.130.0.0/16 blackhole { bgp_large_community.add(LOCAL_COMM); };
}
\end{lstlisting}


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 5.b. Fighting Back from AS-156} 

AS-156 immediately noticed the attack, the operators tried to contact
the operators of AS-3, which is the upstream service provider for AS-160,
asking them to block the attack. Unfortunately, it was midnight for AS-3's
operators, so nobody could be reached. The loss of the service provided 
by AS-156 is very significant, so the operators of AS-156 decide to 
fight back; they want to ``steal'' back their own network prefixes, without the help
of AS-3. Please reconfigure the BGP routers of AS-156, so 
you can get the traffic back. 


% -------------------------------------------
% SUBSECTION
% -------------------------------------------
\subsection{Task 5.c. Fixing the Problem at AS-3} 

Eventually, the operators of AS-3 are reached. Without knowing 
whether this is a misconfiguration on the AS-160 side or an intentional
attack, AS-3 decides not to cut the peering with AS-160, so the users 
of AS-160 can still reach the Internet (AS-3 is the only service 
provider to AS-160). However, AS-3 must stop the propagation of the 
fake announcement. This can be done by removing the 
fake routes from its own announcement to its own peers.
More specifically, AS-3 can add some code to its export 
filter, so the fake routes will not be exported to
the peers.
