# VPN Lab

## For Ubuntu 20.04 VM

TBA

## Container Setup

Because this lab is a comprehensive lab. We will leave it to the 
students to set up the container environment if they choose to
use containers, instead of VMs. Both options are allowed. 
Therefore, we will not update this lab using containers.
