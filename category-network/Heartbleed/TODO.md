# TODO List

Right now this lab can only be conducted on our Ubuntu 12.04, because 
the versions of the OpenSSL in newer Ubuntu OSes have already
fixed the problem. I really want to port this lab to our newest VM,
Ubuntu 20.04. In theory this should doable, because all we need to 
do is to install the older OpenSSL library to the new OS, which 
is quite easy to do. However, we haven't made this lab work yet
in Ubuntu 20.04. Help is needed.
