# Packet Sniffing and Spoofing Lab

## For Ubuntu 20.04 

This lab requires two machines. We are going to use one VM, and then
run a container inside the VM. That gives up two machines. 
The lab description is updated to reflect the change on the setup. 

- When sniffing packets, we need to specify the interface name. 
In 16.04, the default interface is used, so we didn't have to specify
the interface. For the container setup, we have to specify it.

- Other than the above, everything else works the same.
