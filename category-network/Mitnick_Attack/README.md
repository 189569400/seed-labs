# Mitnick Attack Lab

## For Ubuntu 20.04 

This lab requires three machines. We are going to use one VM, and then
run 2 containers inside the VM.
The lab description is updated to reflect the change on the setup. 

- We did not encounter any problem during the VM upgrading.


## Container Setup

- There is no problem switching to the container setup (just make
sure set the interface when calling ```sniff```). 

- The old ```rsh``` programs are installed inside the container. 

- We already created a "seed" account inside the container. When
we are in the container, we shoud "su seed" to get into the seed
account.
