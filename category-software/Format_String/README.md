# Format String Lab

## For Ubuntu 20.04

For this lab, we keep the target vulnerable program 
at the 32-bit, because switching 
to the 64-bit makes the attack more difficult. We have
developed a new lab for the 64-bit programs. 
Here is the summary of the changes made to the lab description
and solutions:

- We added ```-m32``` to all the ```gcc``` command

- Everything else stays the same
